I am Szu-Yu (Eva) Mo (莫絲羽) from Taiwan. Currently I am pursuing a Master's Degree in Robotic Systems Development ([MRSD](https://mrsd.ri.cmu.edu/)). I am studying in the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University (class of 2021). I will also be joing Nvidia autonomus driving team as a computer vision engineer in July, 2021. Please feel free to contact me. 

I received a Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering from National Taiwan University ([NTUEE](https://web.ee.ntu.edu.tw/)) in 2019. Through my undergraduate research at [Intelligent Robot Lab](https://robotlab.csie.ntu.edu.tw/) with Prof. [Li-Chen Fu](http://www.ee.ntu.edu.tw/bio?id=23), I became familiar with semantic visual SLAM implemented with ROS and python. Recently, I just finished my 1.5-year capstone project at CMU with 3 teammates, [AutoValet](https://mrsdprojects.ri.cmu.edu/2020teami/). We have developed an autonomous parking system in indoor environment, and in our case, a parking lot. You could watch our final [demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb5E7sUFKGY&list=LL&index=12) here.

I had three past internship experiences. In my junior year, I was a summer intern at [Coretronic Corporation](https://www.coretronic.com) in Hsinchu, Taiwan, working on a monocular visual SLAM system. Later, I interned at [PicCollage](https://piccollage.com/)(it was first based at Silicon Valley but later moved to Taipei) as a machine learning engineer, developing semantic segmentation models for person cut out feature in the [mobile app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/piccollage-fun-layout-editor/id448639966). Last summer, I worked as a computer vision intern at [Nvidia](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/), enjoying the once-in-a-lifetime remote internship experience.

I am keeping an active Medium [account](https://medium.com/@evamo0508) & [publication](https://medium.com/momo%E7%9A%84%E6%A9%9F%E5%99%A8%E4%BA%BA%E7%95%99%E5%AD%B8%E5%A4%A2), in which I would share my life journey of studying abroad and becoming a software engineer in the self-driving industry (these contents would mostly be written in Mandarin, but Google Translate would be sufficient enough to grasp the ideas). Aside from those, I shared some nerdy projects or tips from time to time too (written in English). I would love any feedbacks/interactions if you feel like my writings do relate to you in any ways. 

Nice to meet you! Together, let's build a better world.
