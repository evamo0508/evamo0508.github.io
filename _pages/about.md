I am Szu-Yu (Eva) Mo (莫絲羽) from Taiwan. Currently I am pursuing my Master's in Robotic Systems Development ([MRSD](https://mrsd.ri.cmu.edu/)) through the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University. Please feel free to browse my homepage and contact me. 

I received a Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering from National Taiwan University ([NTUEE](https://web.ee.ntu.edu.tw/)) in 2019. Through my undergraduate research at [Intelligent Robot Lab](https://robotlab.csie.ntu.edu.tw/) with Prof. [Li-Chen Fu](http://www.ee.ntu.edu.tw/bio?id=23), I became familiar with visual SLAM implemented with ROS and python and gained experiences with semantic segmentation, as well as projects regarding robots gaining social intelligence through reinforcement learning.

I had two internship experiences. First, I worked as a summer intern at [Coretronic Corporation](https://www.coretronic.com) in Hsinchu, Taiwan, working on monocular visual SLAM. Later, I stayed at the startup company [PicCollage](https://piccollage.com/) as a machine learning engineer, developing semantic segmentation models for person cut out.

In this website, I will not only share about my academic projects and engineering career, but also some demonstrations of my interests, including composing songs and assembling mechanical keyboards. Some blog posts regarding application for a US Robotics program and life as a master student in the States will also be updated.
