  * Constructed independently a monocular visual odometry system aimed for drones.
  * Implemented ORB feature extraction with OpenCV and local pose optimization with G2O in C++.

Selected Projects
=====
* [**Visual Search with Semantic Segmentation on ORB SLAM**](https://evamo0508.github.io/projects/visual_search), National Taiwan University, Sep 2018-Jun 2019
  * Combined ORB SLAM and semantic segmentation on each frame into a real-time system that builds semantic point
cloud
  * Designed an effective algorithm to localize target objects in 3D maps.
* **Real-time 3D Reconstruction Using Visual SLAM**, National Taiwan University, Jan-Jun 2018
  * Used Zed stereo camera and Kinect 2 RGB-D camera to implement mapping and localization.
  * Developed Real-Time Appearance-Based Mapping (RTAB-Map) with ROS.
* [**Robots Gain Social Intelligence Through Reinforcement Learning**](https://evamo0508.github.io/projects/social_intelligence_rl), National Taiwan University, Jun 2018
  * Trained the humanoid robot Pepper to learn basic social skills through Proximal Policy Optimization in deep rein- forcement learning, including understanding in what situation it should greet, say bye-bye, shake hands, or simply do
nothing.
* [**Service Robot for Deaf and Speech-impaired People**](https://evamo0508.github.io/projects/service_robot), National Taiwan University, Oct-Dec 2017
  * Trained a convolutional neuron network to recognize sign language videos.
