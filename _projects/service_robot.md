Trained a convolutional neuron network to recognize sign language videos.
Implemented the system to a service humanoid robot to assist deaf and speech-impaired people.

Abstract
======
In this project, we built an application for Pepper which can serve deaf and speech-impaired people. 
Deep learning is used to recognize sign language so that Pepper can understand and interact with those who cannot speak and hear. 
SLAM is also implemented to construct a map for the surroundings and for further navigation. 
With the help of this application, Pepper is able to guide or provide other services for those disabled people.
