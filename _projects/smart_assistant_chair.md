Built a chair with sensors and micro controllers mounted to help lift elders when standing up.

Abstract
======
The elders are often incapable of standing up from a chair on their owns due to the lack of strength in their knees. 
As a result, they need an assistive technology device which can serve as their muscles. 
Our product “Smart Assistant Chair” is made to solve this problem. 
The device can alleviate the elders’ pain by utilizing a motor to elevate their buttons, 
which is activated by sensors noticing one is about to stand up. 
When their buttons are high enough, they could comfortably stand up and walk. 
Moreover, an Android app was developed for data visualization and statistics of this chair. 
In this project, we have successfully constructed a prototype “Smart Assistant Chair” and underwent some testing with people sitting on it. 
In the future, we look forward to making it more stable and even finally commercialize it.
