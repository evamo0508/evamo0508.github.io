This is a follow-up project for the Face Dance Machine. It is deployed on a website instead of a micro controller to extend the usage.

Abstract
======
We deployed a Heroku website for users to play with face-dance-machine, 
meaning that users will have to make similar facial expressions with the cartoon faces shown on screen to win. 
In this project, we utilized several networking knowledge such as video streaming, sound streaming, rate control, 
network security, python flask web application, javascript and html. 
On the application side, we applied facial landmarks detection to the video captured, 
and came up with an algorithm to recognize facial expressions through those landmarks.
